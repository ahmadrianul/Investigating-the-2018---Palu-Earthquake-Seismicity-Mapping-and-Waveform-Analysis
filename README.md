# Investigating the 2018 Palu Earthquake: Seismicity Mapping and Waveform Analysis
This project presents a seismological analysis of the catastrophic 2018 Mw 7.5 Palu, Indonesia, earthquake, leveraging open-source Python tools to process and visualize publicly available data. The investigation begins by mapping the regional seismicity of 2018, which clearly delineates the active trace of the Palu-Koro fault system as the primary source of the event sequence. The core of the analysis then focuses on the teleseismic waveforms from the mainshock, utilizing data from key stations like LUWI and TOLI. This dual-station approach provides crucial azimuthal coverage, enabling a more robust interpretation of the earthquake's rupture dynamics, particularly its well-documented northward supershear propagation. Standard processing techniques, including instrument response removal and a 0.5-2.5 Hz bandpass filter, are applied to clean the raw seismograms, isolating the primary signal from ambient noise. The final analysis combines plots of the filtered waveforms with corresponding spectrograms, offering a comprehensive view that correlates ground motion amplitude over time with its underlying frequency content. This dual visualization is essential for interpreting the complex energy release during this significant strike-slip earthquake.
